## Getting Started
This repository contains custom Symfony Flex recipes tailored for my Symfony bundles and packages. 
To enable recipes defined in this repository for your project, add this endpoint in your project's `composer.json` as described in the 
[Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/flex_private_recipes.html#configure-your-project-s-composer-json-file):
```json
{
    "extra": {
        "symfony": {
            "endpoint": [
                "https://api.github.com/repos/neuralglitch/symfony-recipes/contents/index.json",
                "flex://defaults"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Without this option Composer will not use the Symfony Flex recipes for my bundles, unless the recipes were contributed to
> [symfony/recipes-contrib](https://github.com/symfony/recipes-contrib). Then you will need to follow manual installation
> instructions, if provided. 

> [!NOTE]  
> See [RECIPES.md](https://github.com/serotoninja/symfony-recipes/blob/flex/main/RECIPES.md) for a full list of recipes that live in this repository.
